# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add a language selection dropdown menu to the landing page of the Teto-Egen personality test application. The dropdown will allow users to select their preferred language from a list of the top 15 most spoken languages in the world. When a user selects a language, the application's interface will be translated to that language, enhancing accessibility for users from different linguistic backgrounds.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Language Selection Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to select my preferred language from a dropdown menu, so that I can use the application in a language I understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the landing page THEN the system SHALL display a language selection dropdown in the top-right corner of the page.
2. WHEN the dropdown is clicked THEN the system SHALL display a list of available languages.
3. WHEN a language is selected THEN the system SHALL update the interface to display text in the selected language.
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL detect the user's browser language and set it as the default if supported.
5. IF the user's browser language is not supported THEN the system SHALL default to Korean.

### Requirement 2: Language Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to support the top 15 most spoken languages in the world, so that a wide range of users can access the application in their native language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing language support THEN the system SHALL include translations for the top 15 most spoken languages globally.
2. WHEN displaying language options THEN the system SHALL show each language in its native script along with its name in the current language.
3. WHEN a language is selected THEN the system SHALL store this preference in the browser's local storage.
4. WHEN the user returns to the site THEN the system SHALL remember and apply their language preference.

### Requirement 3: Translation Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement a robust translation system, so that all text content can be easily translated and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing translations THEN the system SHALL use a JSON-based translation file structure for easy maintenance.
2. WHEN adding new content THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism to easily add translations for all supported languages.
3. WHEN displaying translated content THEN the system SHALL handle special characters and right-to-left languages correctly.
4. WHEN a translation is missing for a specific language THEN the system SHALL fall back to the default language (Korean).

### Requirement 4: Visual Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language dropdown to be visually integrated with the existing design, so that it looks like a natural part of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying the language dropdown THEN the system SHALL use styling consistent with the existing application design.
2. WHEN the dropdown is displayed THEN the system SHALL include appropriate icons or flags to visually represent languages.
3. WHEN the dropdown is shown on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL ensure it is properly responsive and usable on small screens.
4. WHEN a language is selected THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to confirm the selection.

### Requirement 5: Performance Considerations

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language switching to be fast and efficient, so that my experience is not disrupted by long loading times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching languages THEN the system SHALL update the interface without requiring a full page reload.
2. WHEN loading the application THEN the system SHALL only load translation resources for the active language.
3. WHEN additional languages are needed THEN the system SHALL load them dynamically to minimize initial load time.
4. WHEN implementing the translation system THEN the system SHALL ensure minimal impact on page performance and load times.
